# README

#### Created by Emma Assiradoo

#### I created this website based off of a desire to learn more about front-end design. 

Functionality as of 1/20/23:
 - Home page styling and text nearly complete. Button effects, color scheme, layout finalized. Buttons connect to GitHub, LinkedIn, and email accounts, buttons connecting to unfinished pages redirect to Home page.

 - Created an Orgs page that can be accessed by clicking "Orgs" at the 
 top of the home screen nav bar.

            </h1> 
            <p>Let's explore a little more :):</p>
            <p>I grew up in Plymouth, Mass and currently go to school in Boston.
                Growing up, I played tennis, loved reading & writing, and was an avid learner- that hasn't changed.
                My junior year I took AP Computer Science Principles, but it wasn't until 
                college that I really developed a love for coding. I have always deeply enjoyed problem solving
                and logic: from <span>murder mysteries</span> to hide and seek and multiple choice questions,
                the chase of finding the right answer- the most efficient and logical one- was 
                a perpetual passion of mine.
            </p>
            <h2>Writing</h2>
            <p>I started keeping a journal in December of 2020-- right in the midst of the 
                glorious college applciation season. I was stressed, overwhelmed, and feeling lost,
                but of course that is not what inspired me to keep a journal. <span>Rather, my best friend
                    told me of hers and of course she should not be the only one to have something
                    jarring her memory when Alzheimer's ultimately claims us, so I, too, began writing.</span> I wrote
                about the mundaneness of what I imagined my future to be- trapped in this capitalistic hamster cage,
                but in reality I was nervous about affording college, and so I projected just a tad. I have always been
                a very calm person, able to think rationally and maintain a certain level of peace, but sending in applciation
                upon applciation wore on me. The writing helped when things became a bit darker for me. There were days when
                it genuinely made me feel better, lighter. And there were days that not even a complete reliquishment of my
                thoughts could make me feel better. But I tried. And that has always, always been enough for me. Because I cannot 
                give Timothy's best or Georgia's- I can only give my own, wherever on the spectrum that may lie. 
            </p>
            <h5>My father, a man who would ask me where the remaining 4% was on the tests I received 96s on,
                told me that all I could do was all I could do. That stuck with me.
            </h5>
            <p>I took AP Literature and AP English and pushed the envelope as far as possible in all my writing classes.
                Honors English freshman year was a thrilling time for me. I had just moved to a new school
                and was incredibly shy, but the day I read my little poem to the class and got "wows" was the day I felt
                like I could belong. Writing has always been accompanied with feelings of inclusivity for me. And I took a 
                creative writing class my junior year, and it was a beautiful experience. Because quite possibly nothing
                gives me the same outlet, ability to express, freedom, that writing does.<span> And from rhymes to tell-alls to thrillers,
                    I love, beyond the words I cherish, writing.</span> Writer's block has never existed to me, I have this sense of guidance
                when I write, and it transcends all. 
            </p>
            <h5>And then college began, with little room for the humanities as a CS & Business major.</h5>
            <P>First-year writing was hard to get through, I won't lie. But it was harder to get over.
                I loved that class, and cried when it ended. I am just about the furthest thing
                from a crier. But it felt like the end of my favorite era, and it was what I call one 
                of life's small deaths. During this class I was fortunate enough to have one of my pieces
                published. It is incredibly personal and <span>delves at the most surface of levels</span> into what
                life entails when you are living with someone in chronic pain. If you Google me, it's there.
            </P>
            <h2>Tennis</h2>
            <p>I began playing tennis at around the <span>ripe old age of 7</span>, and I was not fond of it at first. But I loved the coach.
                Long story short I still talk to that lovely man. I attended his town-run camp for as many years as 
                I could, volunteered when I aged out, and was paid when I could finally legally work. I was a Varsity starter
                my freshman year and had moved up to first singles by the time I was a senior. <span>I loved the sport because it never felt like one.</span> 
                Running has always felt like running and I'm sure if I skiied I'd know I was skiing, but with
                tennis I was just playing. Being. I was with my best friend and she made me laugh uncontrollably and
                we were kind of the same person and it was glorious. So maybe I loved tennis because of her. But I'm not telling her
                I said that because we have to be mindful of egos.
            </p>
            <h2>Morgan Stanley</h2>
            <p>This summer I will be interning in New York at Morgan Stanley working as an Investment Banking Summer 
                Analyst. I think <span>financial literacy is something only the rich have 
                    historically been able to afford</span>, and that's not super vibey. I didn't know what
                a bond was coming into college, but I have tried oh so hard to not simply
                get through the classes I've taken at Northeastern, but to truly learn something from them.
                I want to be a more developed, intelligent, cultured person, and this 4-year
                span of time I have right now is a gift. So I'm unwrapping it.
            </p>
